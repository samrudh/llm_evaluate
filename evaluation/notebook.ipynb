The plans for these crews have varied—from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation).[citation needed] Some have also considered exploring the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos.[3] By 2020, virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, had also been proposed.[4]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars', 'title': 'Human mission to Mars - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

       "[Document(page_content='Conceptual proposals for missions that would involve human explorers started in the early 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.[2] The list of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. The plans for these crews have varied—from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation).[citation needed] Some have also considered exploring the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos.[3] By 2020, virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, had also been proposed.[4]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars', 'title': 'Human mission to Mars - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

Two options are available: rockets or aerocapture. Aerocapture at Mars for human missions was studied in the 20th century.[17] In a review of 93 Mars studies, 24 used aerocapture for Mars or Earth return.[17] One of the considerations for using aerocapture on crewed missions is a limit on the maximum force experienced by the astronauts. The current scientific consensus is that 5 g, or five times Earth gravity, is the maximum allowable deceleration.[17]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars', 'title': 'Human mission to Mars - Wikipedia', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

For the song, see Man on Mars (song).\\\\nConcept for a Mars base, with ice home, pressurized rover, and Mars suits, 2016\\\\nThe idea of sending humans to Mars has been the subject of aerospace engineering and scientific studies since the late 1940s as part of the broader exploration of Mars.[1] Long-term proposals have included sending settlers and terraforming the planet. Currently, only robotic landers and rovers have been on Mars. The farthest humans ...\",\"Conceptual proposals for missions that would involve human explorers started in the early 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.[2] The list of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. The plans for these crews have varied\\\\u2014from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two ...\",\"Meanwhile, the uncrewed exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades, and was first achieved in 1965 with the Mariner 4 flyby. Human missions to Mars have been part of science fiction since the 1880s, and more broadly, in fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films. The concept of a Martian as something living on Mars is part of the fiction. Proposals for human missions to Mars have come from agencies such as ...\",\"Travel to Mars[edit]\\\\nThe minimum distance between the orbits of Mars and Earth from 2014 to 2061, measured in astronomical units\\\\nThe energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or delta-v, is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earth\\\\u2013Mars trips, the period is every 26 months (2 years, 2 months), so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch periods. Due to the eccentricity of Mars&#x27;s orbit, the energy needed in the low-energy periods varies on ro...\",\"Several types of mission plans have been proposed, including opposition class and conjunction class,[6] or the Crocco flyby.[8] The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit, which would involve a roughly 9-month travel time from Earth to Mars, about 500 days (16\\\\u00a0mo)[citation needed] at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth.[9][10] This would be a 34-month trip.\",\"Shorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,[11] or under 15 months, but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days (8.0 months) round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.[12] In 2014, ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.[13]Three views of Mars, Hubble Space Telescope, 1997In the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of...\",\"perhaps 10\\\\u201330 days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle.[15] (See also Mars flyby.)\",\"In the 1980s, it was suggested that aerobraking at Mars could reduce the mass required for a human Mars mission lifting off from Earth by as much as half.[16] As a result, Mars missions have designed interplanetary spacecraft and landers capable of aerobraking.[16]\",\"Landing on Mars[edit]\\\\nInserts depict observation and analysis to find a safe landing site.\\\\nA number of uncrewed spacecraft have landed on the surface of Mars, while some, such as Beagle2 (2003) and the Schiaparelli EDM (2016), have failed what is considered a difficult landing.

Two options are available: rockets or aerocapture. Aerocapture at Mars for human missions was studied in the 20th century....\",\"Survey work[edit]\\\\nConducting a safe landing requires knowledge of the properties of the atmosphere, first observed by Mariner 4, and a survey of the planet to identify suitable landing sites. Major global surveys were conducted by Mariner 9, Viking 1 and two orbiters, which supported the Viking landers. Later orbiters, such as Mars Global Surveyor, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later survey...\",\"Funding[edit]\\\\nA primary limiting factor for sending humans to Mars is funding. In 2010, the estimated cost was roughly US$500 billion. Although the actual costs are likely to be more,[19] this is less than half the cost of the Iraq War in the previous decade.  Starting in the late 1950s, the early phase of space exploration was conducted as much to make a political statement as to make observations of the solar system. However, this proved to be both wasteful and unsustainable, and the current c...\",\"Critics argue that the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars are outweighed by the immense cost, and that funds could be better redirected towards other programs, such as robotic exploration. Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation. There are also claims that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity&#x27;s survival.[19]\",\"One factor reducing the funding needed to place a human presence on Mars may be space tourism. As the space tourism market grows and technological developments are made, the cost of sending humans to other planets will likely decrease accordingly. A similar concept can be examined in the history of personal computers: when computers were used only for scientific research, with minor use in big industry, they were big, rare, heavy, and costly. When the potential market increased and they started ...\",\"Medical[edit]\\\\nMain article: Space medicine\\\\nComparison of radiation doses \\\\u2013 includes the amount detected on a trip from Earth to Mars by the RAD inside the MSL (2011\\\\u20132013).[21][22][23] Vertical axis is in logarithmic scale, so the dose over a Mars year is about 15 times the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) limit, not less than twice, as a quick glance might suggest. The actual dose would depend on factors such as spacecraft design and natural events such as solar flares.\\\\nSeveral key physical chall...\",\"Health threat from cosmic rays and other ionizing radiation.[25][26][27][28] In May 2013, NASA scientists reported that a possible mission to Mars may involve great radiation risk based on energetic particle radiation measured by the radiation assessment detector (RAD) on the Mars Science Laboratory while traveling from the Earth to Mars in 2011\\\\u20132012.

In November 2019, researchers reported that astronauts experienced serious blood flow and clotting problems while on board the International Space Station, based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The results may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to the planet Mars, according to the researchers....\",\"Some of these issues were estimated statistically in the HUMEX study.[37] Ehlmann and others have reviewed political and economic concerns, as well as technological and biological feasibility aspects.[38] While fuel for roundtrip travel could be a challenge, methane and oxygen can be produced using Martian H2O (preferably as water ice instead of liquid water) and atmospheric CO2 with sufficiently mature technology.[39]\",\"Planetary protection[edit]\\\\nSee also: Planetary protection\\\\nRobotic spacecraft to Mars are required to be sterilized. The allowable limit is 300,000 spores on the exterior of general craft, with stricter requirements for spacecraft bound for \\\\\"special regions\\\\\" containing water.[40][41] Otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.[42]\\\\nSterilizing human missions to this level is impossible, as humans are host to typically a hundred...\",\"Mission proposals[edit]\\\\nMain article: List of crewed Mars mission plans\\\\nOver the past seven decades, a wide variety of mission architectures have been proposed or studied for human spaceflights to Mars.

The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) is intended to serve as the launch/splashdown crew delivery vehicle, with a Deep Space Habitat module providing additional living-space for the 16-month-long journey. The first crewed Mars Mission, which would include sending astronauts to Mars, orbiting Mars, and a return to Earth, is proposed for the 2030s.[2][46][47][48] Technology d...\",\"The ESA has a long-term goal to send humans, but has not yet built a crewed spacecraft. It has sent robotic probes such as ExoMars in 2016 and planned to send the next probe in 2022, but the project was suspended due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.[51] It is now looking to send the probe in 2028 with assistance from NASA.[52]\\\\nTechnological innovations and hurdles[edit]\\\\nDepiction of plants growing in a Mars base.

A key problem with propulsive techniques is handling the fluid flow problems and attitude control of the descent ...\",\"Intravenous fluid\\\\nOne of the medical supplies that might be needed is a considerable mass of intravenous fluid, which is mainly water, but contains other substances so it can be added directly to the human blood stream. If it could be created on the spot from existing water, this would reduce mass requirements. A prototype for this capability was tested on the International Space Station in 2010.[59]\\\\n\\\\nAdvanced resistive exercise device\\\\nA person who is inactive for an extended period of time lose...\",\"Breathing gases\\\\nWhile humans can breathe pure oxygen, usually additional gases such as nitrogen are included in the breathing mix. One possibility is to take in situ nitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of Mars, but they are hard to separate from each other.[60] As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.[60]\\\\nAn idea for keeping carbon dioxide out of the breathing air is to use reusable amine-bead carbon dioxide scrubbers.[61] While one carbon dioxide scrubber ...\",\"Missions to Deimos or Phobos[edit]\\\\nMany Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos[63] \\\\u2013 not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission.

One possibility is to take in situ nitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of Mars, but they are hard to separate from each other.[60] As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.[60]\\\\nAn idea for keeping carbon dioxide out of the breathing air is to use reusable amine-bead carbon dioxide scrubbers.[61] While one carbon dioxide scrubber ...\",\"Sample return plans raise the concern, however remote, that an infectious agent could be brought to Earth.[70] Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return has been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)[71]\\\\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions,[72] of which three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing.[72]\\\\nThe rover Perseverance, which lande...\",\"^ \\\\\"Crocco\\\\\".

Later orbiters, such as Mars Global Surveyor, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later survey...\",\"Sample return plans raise the concern, however remote, that an infectious agent could be brought to Earth.[70] Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return has been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)[71]\\\\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions,[72] of which three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing.[72]\\\\nThe rover Perseverance, which lande...\",\"Shorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,[11] or under 15 months, but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days (8.0 months) round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.[12] In 2014, ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.[13]Three views of Mars, Hubble Space Telescope, 1997In the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of...\",\"Mission proposals[edit]\\\\nMain article: List of crewed Mars mission plans\\\\nOver the past seven decades, a wide variety of mission architectures have been proposed or studied for human spaceflights to Mars.

Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation. There are also claims that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity&#x27;s survival.[19]\",\"Medical[edit]\\\\nMain article: Space medicine\\\\nComparison of radiation doses \\\\u2013 includes the amount detected on a trip from Earth to Mars by the RAD inside the MSL (2011\\\\u20132013).[21][22][23] Vertical axis is in logarithmic scale, so the dose over a Mars year is about 15 times the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) limit, not less than twice, as a quick glance might suggest. The actual dose would depend on factors such as spacecraft design and natural events such as solar flares.\\\\nSeveral key physical chall...\",\"Intravenous fluid\\\\nOne of the medical supplies that might be needed is a considerable mass of intravenous fluid, which is mainly water, but contains other substances so it can be added directly to the human blood stream.
