For the song, see Man on Mars (song).\\nConcept for a Mars base, with ice home, pressurized rover, and Mars suits, 2016\\nThe idea of sending humans to Mars has been the subject of aerospace engineering and scientific studies since the late 1940s as part of the broader exploration of Mars.[1] Long-term proposals have included sending settlers and terraforming the planet. Currently, only robotic landers and rovers have been on Mars. The farthest humans ...","Conceptual proposals for missions that would involve human explorers started in the early 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.[2] The list of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. The plans for these crews have varied\\u2014from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two ...","Meanwhile, the uncrewed exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades, and was first achieved in 1965 with the Mariner 4 flyby. Human missions to Mars have been part of science fiction since the 1880s, and more broadly, in fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films. The concept of a Martian as something living on Mars is part of the fiction. Proposals for human missions to Mars have come from agencies such as ...","Travel to Mars[edit]\\nThe minimum distance between the orbits of Mars and Earth from 2014 to 2061, measured in astronomical units\\nThe energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or delta-v, is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earth\\u2013Mars trips, the period is every 26 months (2 years, 2 months), so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch periods. Due to the eccentricity of Mars&#x27;s orbit, the energy needed in the low-energy periods varies on ro...","Several types of mission plans have been proposed, including opposition class and conjunction class,[6] or the Crocco flyby.[8] The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit, which would involve a roughly 9-month travel time from Earth to Mars, about 500 days (16\\u00a0mo)[citation needed] at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth.[9][10] This would be a 34-month trip.","Shorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,[11] or under 15 months, but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days (8.0 months) round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.[12] In 2014, ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.[13]Three views of Mars, Hubble Space Telescope, 1997In the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of...","perhaps 10\\u201330 days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle.[15] (See also Mars flyby.)","In the 1980s, it was suggested that aerobraking at Mars could reduce the mass required for a human Mars mission lifting off from Earth by as much as half.[16] As a result, Mars missions have designed interplanetary spacecraft and landers capable of aerobraking.[16]","Landing on Mars[edit]\\nInserts depict observation and analysis to find a safe landing site.\\nA number of uncrewed spacecraft have landed on the surface of Mars, while some, such as Beagle2 (2003) and the Schiaparelli EDM (2016), have failed what is considered a difficult landing.

Aerocapture at Mars for human missions was studied in the 20th century....","Survey work[edit]\\nConducting a safe landing requires knowledge of the properties of the atmosphere, first observed by Mariner 4, and a survey of the planet to identify suitable landing sites. Major global surveys were conducted by Mariner 9, Viking 1 and two orbiters, which supported the Viking landers. Later orbiters, such as Mars Global Surveyor, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later survey...","Funding[edit]\\nA primary limiting factor for sending humans to Mars is funding. In 2010, the estimated cost was roughly US$500 billion. Although the actual costs are likely to be more,[19] this is less than half the cost of the Iraq War in the previous decade.  Starting in the late 1950s, the early phase of space exploration was conducted as much to make a political statement as to make observations of the solar system. However, this proved to be both wasteful and unsustainable, and the current c...","Critics argue that the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars are outweighed by the immense cost, and that funds could be better redirected towards other programs, such as robotic exploration. Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation. There are also claims that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity&#x27;s survival.[19]","One factor reducing the funding needed to place a human presence on Mars may be space tourism. As the space tourism market grows and technological developments are made, the cost of sending humans to other planets will likely decrease accordingly. A similar concept can be examined in the history of personal computers: when computers were used only for scientific research, with minor use in big industry, they were big, rare, heavy, and costly. When the potential market increased and they started ...","Medical[edit]\\nMain article: Space medicine\\nComparison of radiation doses \\u2013 includes the amount detected on a trip from Earth to Mars by the RAD inside the MSL (2011\\u20132013).[21][22][23] Vertical axis is in logarithmic scale, so the dose over a Mars year is about 15 times the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) limit, not less than twice, as a quick glance might suggest.

These have included chemical, nuclear, and electric propulsion, as well as a wide variety of landing, living, and return methodologies.Artist&#x27;s rendering of the planned Orion/DSH/Cryogenic Propulsion Module assembly\\nA number of nations and organizations have long-term intentions to send humans to...","The United States has several robotic missions currently exploring Mars, with a sample-return planned for the future. The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) is intended to serve as the launch/splashdown crew delivery vehicle, with a Deep Space Habitat module providing additional living-space for the 16-month-long journey. The first crewed Mars Mission, which would include sending astronauts to Mars, orbiting Mars, and a return to Earth, is proposed for the 2030s.[2][46][47][48] Technology d...","The ESA has a long-term goal to send humans, but has not yet built a crewed spacecraft. It has sent robotic probes such as ExoMars in 2016 and planned to send the next probe in 2022, but the project was suspended due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.[51] It is now looking to send the probe in 2028 with assistance from NASA.[52]\\nTechnological innovations and hurdles[edit]\\nDepiction of plants growing in a Mars base. NASA plans to grow plants for space food.[53]\\nNASA has stated that robots will prep...","Entry into the thin and shallow Martian atmosphere will pose significant difficulties with re-entry; compared to Earth&#x27;s much denser atmosphere, any spacecraft will descend very rapidly to the surface and must be slowed.[55] A heat shield has to be used.[56] NASA is carrying out research on retropropulsive deceleration technologies to develop new approaches to Mars atmospheric entry. A key problem with propulsive techniques is handling the fluid flow problems and attitude control of the descent ...","Intravenous fluid\\nOne of the medical supplies that might be needed is a considerable mass of intravenous fluid, which is mainly water, but contains other substances so it can be added directly to the human blood stream. If it could be created on the spot from existing water, this would reduce mass requirements. A prototype for this capability was tested on the International Space Station in 2010.[59]\\n\\nAdvanced resistive exercise device\\nA person who is inactive for an extended period of time lose...","Breathing gases\\nWhile humans can breathe pure oxygen, usually additional gases such as nitrogen are included in the breathing mix. One possibility is to take in situ nitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of Mars, but they are hard to separate from each other.[60] As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.[60]\\nAn idea for keeping carbon dioxide out of the breathing air is to use reusable amine-bead carbon dioxide scrubbers.[61] While one carbon dioxide scrubber ...","Missions to Deimos or Phobos[edit]\\nMany Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos[63] \\u2013 not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission. Lockheed Martin, as part of their \\"Stepping stones to Mars\\" project, called the \\"Red Rocks Project\\", proposed to explore Mars robotically from Deimos.[64][65][66]\\nUse of fuel produced from water resources on Phobos or Deimos ha...","Mars sample return missions[edit]\\nSample return mission concept\\nAn uncrewed Mars sample return mission (MSR) has sometimes been considered as a precursor to crewed missions to Mars&#x27;s surface.[67] In 2008, the ESA called a sample return \\"essential\\" and said it could bridge the gap between robotic and human missions to Mars.[67] An example of a Mars sample return mission is Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars.[68] Mars sample return was the highest priority Flagship Mission proposed for NA...","Sample return plans raise the concern, however remote, that an infectious agent could be brought to Earth.[70] Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return has been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)[71]\\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions,[72] of which three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing.[72]\\nThe rover Perseverance, which lande...","Crewed orbital missions[edit]\\nMars orbital command module; Manned module to control robots and Mars aircraft without the latency of controlling it from Earth.\\nStarting in 2004, NASA scientists have proposed to explore Mars via telepresence from human astronauts in orbit.[75][76]\\nA similar idea was the proposed \\"Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic Operations\\" mission.[77][78]\\nIn order to reduce communications latency, which ranges from 4 to 24 minutes,[79] a manned Mars orbital station has ...","See also[edit]\\n\\nDelta-v budget\\u00a0\\u2013 Estimate of total change in velocity of a space mission\\nLife on Mars\\u00a0\\u2013 Scientific assessments on the microbial habitability of Mars\\nList of missions to Mars\\nMars analog habitat\\u00a0\\u2013 Research simulating the environment on Mars\\nMars Desert Research Station\\u00a0\\u2013 Longest-running Mars analog habitat\\nMars Design Reference Mission\\u00a0\\u2013 Conceptual design studies for crewed missions to Mars\\nMars Society\\u00a0\\u2013 Advocacy group for Mars exploration\\nSpace weather\\u00a0\\u2013 Branch of space physics ...","^ a b Wall, Mike (27 August 2019). \\"Astronauts Will Face Many Hazards on a Journey to Mars \\u2013 NASA is trying to bring the various risks down before launching astronauts to Mars in the 2030s\\".

The rover Perseverance, which landed on Mars in 2021, plays a crucial role in this mission as it is equipped with a device that allows it to collect rock samples to be returned at a later date by another mission.","The shortest possible round-trip flight time to Mars is 245 days or 8.0 months. In a Hohmann transfer orbit, the travel time from Earth to Mars would be roughly 9 months.","The proposed timeline for missions to Mars has typically been stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted. The travel time from Earth to Mars is roughly 9 months, about 500 days (16 months) at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth. This would total a 34-month trip.","Arguments against establishing a human presence on Mars include the immediate benefits being outweighed by the immense cost, and the suggestion that funds could be used more effectively in other programs like robotic exploration. In support of a human mission to Mars, proponents argue that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space could attract public interest and encourage global cooperation. They also claim that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity&#x27;s survival.

It only displays languages, tools, actions, general information, print/export options, and other projects.","Mars colonists could potentially live in red-brick houses.","Sterilizing human missions to Mars is considered impossible because humans are host to typically a hundred trillion (1014) microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiota, and these cannot be removed.","The calculated radiation dose for a round-trip mission to Mars was 0.66 sieverts.","The &#x27;Red Rocks Project&#x27; proposed by Lockheed Martin is part of their &#x27;Stepping stones to Mars&#x27; project, which proposes to explore Mars robotically from Deimos.","The farthest humans have been beyond Earth is the Moon, under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA&#x27;s) Apollo program which ended in 1972.","The greatest challenge of a Mars mission might be the trauma of isolation.","NASA confirmed evidence that liquid water flows on Mars on September 28, 2015.","The &#x27;Red Rocks Project&#x27; proposed by Lockheed Martin, as part of their &#x27;Stepping stones to Mars&#x27; project, is to explore Mars robotically from Deimos. Furthermore, fuel produced from water resources on Phobos or Deimos has been proposed for use.","A large solar storm sparked a global aurora and doubled the radiation levels on the Martian surface, and one significant health concern for human missions to Mars is the loss of bone mineral density in astronauts.","Landing on Mars is considered difficult due to the need for precise observation and analysis to find a safe landing site. Yes, there have been unsuccessful attempts such as Beagle2 in 2003 and the Schiaparelli EDM in 2016.","The intravenous fluid, which is mainly water, but contains other substances can be added directly to the human blood stream and would be needed as a medical supply for astronauts. An Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) would be needed in the spaceship to prevent loss of strength, muscle and bone mass, as spaceflight conditions are known to cause loss of bone mineral density in astronauts, increasing bone fracture risk.","Landing on the surface of Mars is considered a difficult landing, and not all attempts to land uncrewed spacecraft on Mars have been successful. For example, Beagle2 (2003) and the Schiaparelli EDM (2016) have failed.","The main health threat for human missions to Mars is from cosmic rays and other ionizing radiation, and the calculated radiation dose for a possible mission to Mars was 0.66 sieverts round-trip.","The Reference Mission Design Reference Mission 1.0 is a part of the Human Exploration of Mars project and physical features of Mars include &#x27;Canals&#x27;, Canyons, Catenae, Chaos terrain, Craters, Fossae, Gullies, Mensae, Labyrinthi, Mountains, Observed rocks, Outflow channels, Plains, Valley network, and Valleys.","The purpose of the survey work conducted on Mars is to gather knowledge of the properties of the atmosphere and to identify suitable landing sites for a safe landing. The later surveys have identified the probable locations of water, a critical resource.","The Mars sample return mission (MSR) is considered as a precursor to crewed missions to Mars&#x27;s surface, bridging the gap between robotic and human missions. The rover Perseverance, which landed on Mars in 2021, plays a crucial role by being equipped with a device that allows it to collect rock samples to be returned at a later date by another mission.","A fast Mars mission could have a round trip of 245 days (8.0 months) with on-orbit staging, and the travel time from Earth to Mars in a Hohmann transfer orbit would be roughly 9 months.","The first crewed Mars Mission, which would include sending astronauts to Mars, orbiting Mars, and a return to Earth, is proposed for the 2030s.","Critics argue that the immense cost of establishing a human presence on Mars outweighs the immediate benefits, and suggest that funds could be better used for other programs, such as robotic exploration. On the other hand, proponents of human space exploration believe that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space could attract public interest, stimulate global cooperation, and argue that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity&#x27;s survival.","The calculated radiation dose for a round trip mission to Mars is 0.66 sieverts.","Spaceflight conditions are known to cause loss of bone mineral density in astronauts, increasing bone fracture risk. The most recent mathematical models predict 33% of astronauts will be at risk for osteoporosis during a human mission to Mars.","The information about human missions to Mars is from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.","Some organizations advocating for Mars exploration include The Mars Project, The Case for Mars, Inspiration Mars Foundation, Mars Institute, and Mars Society.","The proposed plans for crewed Mars missions have varied. They include scientific expeditions, in which a small group of astronauts would visit Mars for a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation. Some plans have also considered exploring the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos. By 2020, virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, had also been proposed.","The calculated radiation dose for a round-trip mission to Mars is 0.66 sieverts.","The maximum allowable deceleration for astronauts using aerocapture on crewed missions is 5 g, or five times Earth gravity.","Yes, some uncrewed spacecraft, such as Beagle2 (2003) and the Schiaparelli EDM (2016), have failed what is considered a difficult landing on Mars."]],["id",[27,32,10,51,0,49,26,29,34,32,16,3,27,4,48,31,41,53,43,52,55,23,44,1,39,24,41,34,46,31,6,35,1,43,20,35,27,2,31,34,27,37,10,25,10,16,50,12,29,7,21,14,16,25,1,52,3,36,11,10]],["content",["Missions to Deimos or Phobos[edit]\\nMany Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos[63] \\u2013 not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission.
